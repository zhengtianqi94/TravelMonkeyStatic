                        California Highway 1, beautiful scenery, unique in the world. Always have the opportunity to
                        travel by car trip. Fortunately, in June last year and August of this year, it is a chance to
                        travel to the In-N-Out chain of fast-food restaurants on a business trip to Kettleman City,
                        California, a city between Los Angeles and Interstate 5 in the interstate. Since the city is in
                        a remote area, fly from the southeast, preferably to Los Angeles or San Francisco, and then rent
                        a car. The specific itinerary is to drive to go interstate 5 high-speed go, after completing the
                        return journey to California Coastal Road. From Los Angeles in June last year, from San
                        Francisco in August this year, merged twice, just in between Los Angeles and San Francisco, take
                        a trip to Interstate 5 and the 1st California Highway.<br><br>

                        In fact, two working hours are not long, but do not want to tired, as far as possible relaxed
                        schedule, east and west coast to do three days back and forth arrangements, fly to California
                        the first day; the next day, as Kettelman from Los Angeles or San Francisco drive back and forth
                        At least 400 miles, time is full, and do not want to take the Red Eye flight back to the
                        southeastern United States; but fly back the third day. When I flew to Los Angeles last year, it
                        was interesting that I was arranged in the middle of the three people due to the full flight
                        attendants. I did not care about this matter, nor did I complain, but afterward, Delta Airlines,
                        in order to express my apologies, specially rewarded me some mileage. Small things reflect the
                        high standards of their customer service. This August 10 this year, flying to San Francisco, it
                        is the United States burst Oolong what power failure, resulting in the global paramedic of Delta
                        Air Lines, is slowly returning to normal operation, they remind me by mail, may cancel the
                        flight or late, bringing inconvenience Also looking sea han. Indeed, over the years I think
                        Delta customer service is still quite good. Haha, pull away, but also take the question, or get
                        things back.<br><br>

                        The north-south California State Route 1 is one of the most beautiful state-of-the-art scenic
                        roads recognized by the federal government for outstanding quality in archeology, culture,
                        history, nature, landscapes, and leisure. And the unique characteristics of the road.
                        California's Highway 1 runs south of Los Angeles to Dana Point, north of San Francisco's
                        Leggett, and runs 650 miles. It winds its way along the west coast of the Pacific Ocean and has
                        numerous beautiful scenery along the coast, arguably the most beautiful and well-known national
                        scenic route in California.<br><br>

                        To Ketteleman services need to arrive before 9 o'clock in the morning, before they open the door
                        at 10 o'clock to get things done. Flew to Los Angeles on June 1 last year and lived in Los
                        Angeles. So the next morning it rose up to the north on Interstate 5. Get off the road and
                        follow California Highway 41 west to Morro Bay, a coastal city, then head south on Highway 1
                        back to Los Angeles. Out of Ketteleman, all the way to the desert, almost two hours drive to
                        Morro Bay.<br><br>

                        The most distinctive of Morro Bay is the Morro Rock monuments, the city that has its name for
                        the stone. Moruo rock is a volcano bolt nearly 600 feet (175 meters) high, it stands in the
                        harbor entrance. It was initially surrounded by water, but during the process of port
                        construction, the North Course was filled to connect with the coast. Another is the tall,
                        three-finger chimney, which locals call the three side-by-side chimneys of the Dynegy Power
                        Station, which is located off Morro Harbor. Morro Harbor is not large, the roadside seafood shop
                        at every family has caught the fish the same day, at the back door of a store, saw a red fish,
                        really want to buy it and take home.<br><br>

                        South of Morro Bay is the hilly terrain, there is no coastal road, near Pismo Beach, take the
                        coastal road, where the charming look, stop the car to the beach and walk. There are spectacular
                        white sand beaches, strolling on the pier and enjoy the sunshine, waves, seabirds, sea breeze
                        leisurely mood, feeling like a seabird free fly. Near the beach, there are State Visitor Center
                        and Outlet Mall, it seems like a lot of tourists holiday here.

                        Continue south on Route 1 and go through the hills, mountains, plains and Vandenberg Air Force
                        Base to Gaviota before returning to the coastal road. As this process does not take the coastal
                        road, I personally think that taking the 101 State Road can save a lot of time. Before I got
                        into Santa Barbara, I saw the Amtrak train on the coast and I had not heard of the rumbling of
                        the train for a long time.<br><br>

                        Stop at Cayucos and look south, the Morro rock is clearly visible in the sea. Flat and open
                        coastline, endless spectacular. Roadside hills covered with hay aroused my attention and
                        curiosity, all the way to see the grass is brown, including on the 5th International Road, many
                        places are hay, with the desert landscape like, why big These summer grass is not green? I guess
                        the first reason is less drought, and the second reason is the grass species. Confirmed with
                        friends later is the reason for the drought, California drought serious, had to strictly limit
                        the water. California's state departments and even legislation allow people to spray brown dry
                        lawns green or allow artificial plastic lawns. It is said that the rain in spring is more, the
                        grass naturally will be green.<br><br>

                        At Cambria, wander around the seaside community park and feel peaceful and laid-back. The next
                        stop is San Simeon, home to the famous Hershey Castle State Park, and there are quite a few
                        Chinese here. Magnificent castle is located on the top of the hill, halfway up the tourist
                        center, visitors need to buy tickets take the bus to the castle to visit. I asked how long it
                        took to visit, and the answer was 2-3 hours. I decided to look only at the Hershey's Castle
                        Museum in the Visitor Center and continue on my hurry. A few minutes drive to the walrus beach,
                        there are a lot of tourists, we rushed to the beach row of lazy walrus group photo, there are
                        also for the protection of these walrus donations enthusiasts, the care of animal heart
                        Admirable.<br><br>

                        Then go full steam ahead, ear back to your sister, you boldly move forward singing, leisurely
                        mood is self-evident. Came to California Sea Otter Game Refuge Looking back at the Point Sur
                        Lightstation in the sand and fog, it feels like a hazy poem. Not far north is the 80-year-old
                        Bixby Creek Bridge, one of the most sought-after classics on Route 1, with breathtaking beauty.<br><br>

                        Twice the car, the weather to force, almost sunny, but in the Big Sur, the weather a bit
                        unpredictable, but did not rain. Every time it opened almost 500 miles of course, the time is
                        still a little tight, coupled with traffic jams, even more nervous. Open to the evening, in
                        order to hurry basically no time to stop, it is regrettable to give up some attractions. If you
                        have a chance, but also want to come back to visit Big Sur Scenic.<br><br>

                        Personally think that stretches from Carmel beach to Heels Castle Big Sur section, unique
                        scenery, very mood, is the most exciting section of the most exciting. Panshan along the road,
                        one side is the blue waves of the Pacific Ocean, with cliffs, while stretching the backdrop of
                        spectacular, this is "critical" stimulus. Sometimes the sun, sometimes fog, the top of the
                        mountain can not distinguish between white clouds or white fog, the ever-changing climate,
                        winding coastline, the sea, fog-filled mountains, as well as the sound of sea waves to form a 4D
                        Splendid picture scroll, which is Enjoy nature's natural masterpieces. Immersive, beautiful,
                        breathtaking. California Highway No. 1 You met the most beautiful coastal scenery.<br><br>
